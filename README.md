# Discord Leveling Library wrapper for Python
**discord-leveling-py** is a wrapper of the **NPM**'s [**discord-leveling**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-leveling) library for Python.

## How to use
This is just a freaking 30-lined JS file with a switch statement and another 22-lined python file with a bunch of functions with only 1 line each, you don't need any kind of guide.

If you need a guide on how to use this, please consider watching:
`HTML programming course for beginners` on YouTube.
